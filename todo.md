# TODO

* Change input methods to store user input in a global array instead of using a callback model
	* User input can then be acted upon in a layer's "update" method
	* I dunno, I kinda like the callback style, helps keep the update method a bit slimmer and keeps user code in one place
* Create a "UI" canvas and "action" canvas for each layer

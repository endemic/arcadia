# TODO

* Fix the draw method mess - 
	* Give objects that require canvas drawing a "children" property; each child of an object added to the canvas draw layer also gets drawn
* Create buttons
* Change input methods to store user input in a global array instead of using a callback model
	* User input can then be acted upon in a layer's "update" method
* Create a UI layer?

# TODO

* Fix the draw method mess - 
	* Give objects that require canvas drawing a "children" property; each child of an object added to the canvas draw layer also gets drawn
* Create particle emitter
* Create text label
	* Update positioning code to attempt to have a centered anchor point
* Create buttons
* Pre-render sprites onto a canvas property; drawing then just entails copying that canvas

# Arcadia.js

A minimalist &lt;canvas> game framework.

## Overview

An Arcadia game is mainly made up of _Scenes_ and _Shapes_. A scene is an
encapsulated part of a game, such as a title, difficulty select, or actual
gameplay. A shape is a game object, such as the player, enemies, or
projectiles. To create a game, make an object that use _Arcadia.Scene_ as the prototype,
then populate it with _Arcadia.Shape_ objects.

# TODO

[ ] Change `tween` object to use a Pool
[ ] Maybe change Scene's `color` prop to `clearColor`
[ ] Handle making canvas cache large enough for shadow/blur
[ ] Shadow isn't drawn if shape is transparent
[ ] Allow strings to be passed for border, font, shadow, etc. instead of objects - use setter methods
[ ] Ensure correct anchor point for shapes when using large shadows
[ ] Canvas scaling when pinned to screen in Android is strange
[ ] Add SAT collision detection
[ ] Cull drawing of objects outwide viewport
[ ] Rename Emitter to "Particles" or something
[ ] Update particle emitter to emit particles infinitely; can turn on/off
[ ] Add additional effects to particles: rotate, fade, scale, etc.
